Construct the main function for our Operating System simulator using C. Consult the attached .c file for some tips.

-Functional OS loop, with branching based on opcode (no implementations for opcodes required yet, just need to be able to distinguish between opcodes): 50%

-Operating system state correctly defined (all registers and required data members present): 25%

-Working file input (to be used to determine opcode): 25%

If your code fails to compile due to syntax errors: -75%

Segmentation faults and logic errors will count against the portions above.

When grading, I will check your loop to see if it can extract the opcode from a file. One such file is provided as "testProcess.txt". You may hard code this file input, query the user, or provide a launch parameter with the file name.

Make sure to only submit your source code (.c) and no compiled files; these will not be accepted. Submissions via email will be ignored and deleted.
